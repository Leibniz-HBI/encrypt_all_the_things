# Why are we here?

Note:
* Over the next 2 hours we are going to explore common security and privacy concerns for researchers & some solutions to them.
* We are assuming that you already know to keep your OS and software up to date.
Many updates are to fix security problems, so this is important to do.
* use of coloured stickynotes - pink one: help, green one: finished activity.
* asking questions - put up pink stickynote to indicate you want to ask a question.
* To get started thinking about security & privacy let's run through a few examples.

----

# worst case scenarios

----

## weak password reuse

your Twitter account is hacked by angry gamergaters â€“ and suddenly your devices are wiped

----

## Activity!

Visit https://haveibeenpwned.com/ and look up your most used email address, to see whether your data has been published after a successful cyber attack or data breach.

Note:
* Define pwned - 'Owned'
* demo first on our own account.
* now go ahead and check your email

----

## revealing IP address

researching in extremist bulletin boards/social networks
getting harassed in your neighbourhood afterwards

----

## Activity!

visit https://browserleaks.com

Note:
* QUESTION: Any surprises?
* we will be using this tool again later in the workshop

----

## unencrypted communication

communication with protesters in an authoritarian surveillance state via iMessage but message gets sent via SMS service

----

## unencrypted devices

interview with journalist in country oppressing the press with 'off-the-record' content on unencrypted Android phone, laptop or USB drive gets confiscated at the airport before leaving the country

Note:
* even if something similar might have happened, all examples are made up
* 15 minutes in!

----

## Metadata retention

<img src='encrypt_all_the_things_slides/img/snitch_hunt.png' width="60%">

(http://www.abc.net.au/triplej/programs/hack/how-team-of-pre-teens-found-whisteblower-using-metadata/8113668)

Note:
* This is a privacy and security risk faced by everyone, not just researchers.
* Would any of you like to suggest a definition of metadata?
* One way of considering metadata is as activity records - records of what you have done and when, but not the content of what you have done.
* The slide shows a news article about a realistic metadata game where a team of pre-teens identified a whistleblower in less than 2 hours

---

# Passwords
one ring to rule you all <font size="3"><sub>might not be a good idea</sub></font>

----

## Main risks

Especially when you've been pwned:

* common password (qwerty, 12345, monkey, love, ...)
* easy to guess (qwerty12345, your name, your birthday, your partners birthday, your postcode, )
* reuse of passwords
* storing password in an unsafe place (i.e. unencrypted and accessible from outside)
* forgetting your password

----

## Solution #1:

### Use a password manager

Note:
QUESTIONS:
* Who is using a password manager?
* Which one?

----

## What is a password manager?

* allows you to access all your passwords with a master password and/or keyfile ("secret file", e.g. on a USB stick)
* stores passwords in an encrypted file (i.e. not readable without a key)
* can often generate secure passwords for you

Therefore your passwords will be strong, will not be reused, and you don't have to worry about memorising them anymore.

----

## We recommend (1/2)

* KeePass, KeePassXC, KeeWeb
    * Open source and free +
    * interoperable +
    * high reputation +
    * all data under your control +/-
    * inconvenient -
    * insecure if used incorrectly -

----

## We recommend (2/2)

* 1Password
    * high reputation +
    * very convenient +
    * encourages best practices +
    * costs money -
    * closed source -

Note:
* links to all these are provided on the resources page at end of presentation

----

## Solution #2:

### Use 2-factor authentication

----

## What is 2-factor authentication?

* something you know (your password) and something you have (your device)
* having device is verified by either
  * sending second code to you by SMS or
  * generating it in an App on your device
* this second element changes each time

Note:
* most secure forms of this are bound to a device you carry with you, e.g. an app on your phone, or even more secure on a dedicated device
* best practice internet services have it, if service you are using doesn't it might be a warning sign

----

## SMS is not a secure channel!

![Due to today's incident, it's possible some SMS messages were incorrectly delivered. All messages will be held while we resolve the issue.](encrypt_all_the_things_slides/img/TelstraSMSProblemsTweet.png)

Note:
* In February 2017 Telstra (Australian telecom provider) outage caused by fire in Sydney exchange resulted in many SMS's being delivered to wrong phones

----

## SMS problems

* mis-delivery
* unauthorised phone number porting
* not available during phone outages
* not encrypted - can be intercepted with scanner

Note:
* There have been examples in news lately of people repeatedly having their numbers ported just using their name and DOB as authorisation
* Same Telstra outage early this year stopped people receiving SMS for 2FA

----

## We recommend

Use an app for 2 factor authentication:

* [FreeOTP](https://freeotp.github.io/)
* [Google Authenticator (Android/iPhone/BlackBerry)](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/1066447?hl=en)
* [Authy](https://www.authy.com/app/)

Note:
* links to these are provided in the resources section

----

Which services provide 2-factor-authentication?

Note:
* ask people to suggest services which support 2fa & write on board/paper.

---

# Researcher privacy

----

## Main risks

when researching on the internet:

* activity record (metadata) retention (by state/institution/ad networks)
    * by IP address (like a 'phone number' for your computer)
    * by browser cookies (like customer cards in shops, just for your browser)
* revealing of personal details to website owners
* other forms of browser finger printing

Note:
* your IP address may reveal your location, and stays the same at least during a single session, and possibly all the time. This means it can be used to track your visits across multiple websites
* browser cookies are stored on your computer and used to customise your experience of a website, but can also be used to track your use of a website and even between websites.
* if you login to a website you have provide your account details to that website and your IP address
* new ways of identifying website visits are always being explored, for example using which fonts your browser reports as a finger print to identify your browser.

----

## Solution #1:

### Virtual Private Network (VPN) 'tunnel'

----

## What is a VPN?

* prevents eavesdropping, e.g. in an open WiFi
* hides your traffic from your Internet Service Provider
* hides your IP address (i.e. location, internet provider, other visited websites) from servers you communicate with
* can make you appear to be in another country and circumvent DNS or geo-blocking
* does NOT replace https

----

## We recommend

Choose a VPN service which:

* claims not to store activity records (hard to verify)
* uses OpenVPN
* has servers in safe jurisdictions
* does not insert advertising into your browsing stream

Remember that if it's too cheap you might be paying in other ways.

[ProtonVPN](https://protonvpn.com/) (based in Switzerland) by the team behind ProtonMail, [NordVPN](https://nordvpn.com/) (b.i. Panama) and [Private Internet Access](https://www.privateinternetaccess.com/) (b.i. USA) both have had a long term high reputation.

----

## Solution #2:

### Tor Browser

----

## What is Tor Browser?

* provides more secure browser that avoids leaving traces (e.g. it does not store cookies)
* connects to websites through onion-network (encrypted tunnel through encrypted tunnel through encrypted tunnel ...)
* does not prevent you from disclosing your identity e.g. by logging into Facebook

----

## We recommend

Use TorBrowser for high risk research, not for everyday use.

Note:
* for high risk research get expert advice!

----

## Activity!

Install Tor Browser and visit https://browserleaks.com again.

Tor Browser: https://www.torproject.org/download/download.html.en

Note:
* Explain about using signatures to verify downloads?
* What did you find was different in browserleaks report?

---

# Data storage

----

## Main risks

when storing data:

* unauthorised access to data, e.g. in the cloud
* unwanted access to devices, e.g. if stolen or taken by authorities
* data loss
* lost access

----

## Solution

----

# backup, backup, backup

Follow the **3-2-1 backup rule** and have at least

* **3** independent copies,
* in **2** locations,
* of which **1** is offline

Note: research storage - QUT provides properly tape backed up storage for research data (rstore).

----

AND

----

![](http://blog.serverfault.com/files/2016/02/encrypt-all-the-things1.png)

**... but don't forget your keys.**
*(hint: use a password manager)*

----

## We recommend

* full device/disk/USB stick â€¦ encryption (mostly provided by OS)
* for files in the cloud:
    * [Cryptomator](https://cryptomator.org/)
    * [keybase](https://keybase.io/)
    * disk image encryption by your operating system

**MAKE SURE YOU NEVER LOOSE YOUR KEYS OR PASSPHRASES!!!**</br>
Or all is lost.

Note:
* Most encryption services offer multiple ways of storing your keys or passphrases - take advantage of them, but make sure you store the keys or passphrases securely.

---

# Communication

----

## Main risks

While transmitting sensitive information: the men in the middle (MTM)

* your email/messaging provider or anybody who has hacked them or pretends to be them
* authorities who subpoena any of your communication providers
* others in open/untrusted WiFi

<img src="encrypt_all_the_things_slides/img/wifi-ios.png" class="fragment" width="40%">

Note:
* Email is like a postcard, even the post office can read it

----

## Solution #1:

### https

----

## What is https?

* browser checks whether website has a valid certificate ('ID card')
* encrypts traffic between browser and website

----

## We recommend

* check the address bar in your browser
![](encrypt_all_the_things_slides/img/2017-02-05%20at%201.41%20pm.png)

* https://www.eff.org/https-everywhere


Examples for bad certificates: https://badssl.com/dashboard/

Note: HTTPS Everywhere is a Firefox, Chrome, and Opera extension that encrypts your communications with many major websites

----

## Solution #2:

### PGP

"Pretty Good Privacy"

----

## What is PGP encryption?

* Encryption protects your information so that no one except the intended recipient can read it.

* PGP adds two extra features by using a Public Key:
  * it allows you to encrypt information for a recipient without contacting them first - using their Public Key
  * you can verify that information signed by them is from them

----

## We recommend

* [keybase](https://keybase.io/)
* [GPGTools](https://gpgtools.org/) for MacOS
* [GPG4win](https://www.gpg4win.org/) for Windows
* email clients with GPG support (e.g. Thunderbird)

Note:

----

## Using Keybase

With an account on [keybase.io](https://keybase.io) it is easy to encrypt a message to somebody else. Let's try it!

----

## Whoot! So how did that work?

Let's call the public key a 'padlock'.

----

Red has a secret message for Green

<img src="encrypt_all_the_things_slides/img/PGP/PGP1.png" width=70%>

----

Red encrypts message with Green's public padlock

<img src="encrypt_all_the_things_slides/img/PGP/PGP2.png" width=70%>

----

Sent message is unreadable without Green's secret key

<img src="encrypt_all_the_things_slides/img/PGP/PGP3.png" width=70%>

----

Green decrypts the message with their secret key

<img src="encrypt_all_the_things_slides/img/PGP/PGP4.png" width=70%>

----

Done :)

<img src="encrypt_all_the_things_slides/img/PGP/PGP5.png" width=70%>

----

## Using PGP to sign things

As well as encrypting messages and files, PGP can be used to sign things:
* PGP signature verifies content and sender of item
* can be used to certify unencrypted emails or files
* will fail if message or file is changed

----

## Using PGP to verify identities

PGP can also be used to verify peoples public keys - by signing a public key you are saying you are confident that the key belongs to the person it says it belongs to.

On keybase this is done by following people and posting signed messages on other platforms.

----

## And how does signing work?

That's where the padlock metaphor stops working. Ask later :)

----

## Solution #3:

### Secure messenger / private messaging

----

## What is a secure messenger?

* encrypts message end-to-end per default (i.e. messages are only readable by sender and recipient, not by the message service provider)
* explicitly does not store activity records (metadata)
* is open source
* optional: has self-destructing messages (i.e. messages are deleted on both ends after a pre-defined timespan)

----

## We recommend

for private messaging:

[Signal](https://whispersystems.org/)

for work/team communications:

[Keybase](https://keybase.io)

----

## Safely using secure messaging and encryption

* make sure you confirm that the account you are dealing with (Public Key or Signal account) is who you expect to be at the other end
  * verify using separate channel
  * for chat, make sure encryption is working before exchanging any critical information
* your Keybase account is good for improving security, but you should create fresh PGP keypairs for very secure communications

Note:
* Get expert advice, may also need to setup more secure computer

---

# How to choose a tool?

----

## Things to consider

1. Open Source?
2. Reputation?
3. Independent security audit?
4. Will you actually use it?

---

## Where to from here?

At end of the presentation there is a list of all the software we've mentioned today and a list of useful websites for more information.

* Start using some of these tools!
* Use the suggested websites to become better informed!
* Keep your devices' software & application software up to date!

----

## Get expert advice

Depending on the level of risk to you or your research participants you may need to seek advice from a security/privacy expert before you begin your research.

Note:
* Risks/Solutions are changing over time, so important to get current advice before you start your research.
